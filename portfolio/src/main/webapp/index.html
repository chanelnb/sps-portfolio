      <p> <b> <i> I am Chanel Brown, a sophomore at University of North Carolina at Greensboro studying Computer Science. I am originally from Charlotte, North Carolina. My hobbies include working at my job, Best Buy, and learning new things day by day. </b> </i> </p>
      
      
      <h2 align="center"> <u>My Mission Statement</u> </h2>
          
                  <h2>Being a first-generation college student, the pressure is on you to succeed but most
importantly the pressure is on you to become someone. </h2>
                  <h3>I possess the utmost confidence in my
ability to succeed because I have the drive to overcome any challenge.</h3>
                 
                  <h4>The computer
science field lacks the diversity of minority women. With this program, a goal for me is to increase the
statistics of women in technology. I plan on achieving so by being a role model in my community,
by graduating college and furthering my education, to show that women can be just as successful
in this field. This opportunity allows me to go further with pursuits in my education to make a
difference in my family and make a difference in my community as well.</h4>
